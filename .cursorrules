# Cursor Rules for Career Autopilot
- Prefer Pydantic models for all LLM IO contracts.
- Write unit tests first for each endpoint and agent function.
- No global state: pass context via typed objects.
- Every side-effect (files, sheet writes, emails) must log a JSON line to apps/backend/logs/app.log.
- Keep prompts short and deterministic.
- Preserve candidate essence; never invent projects or facts.
